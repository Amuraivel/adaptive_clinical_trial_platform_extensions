# Multi-Source-Adaptive-Platform-Design
Corresponding R code for "A Multi-source Adaptive Platform Design for Testing Sequential Combinatorial Therapeutic Strategies" manuscript. Briefly, a platform trial design which incorporates multi-source exchangeability models (MEMs) to leverage supplemental information from past trial segments and adaptive randomization to balance overall information allocation within a segment.

GitHub_Functions_AdaptivePlatformDesign.R: a set of functions for implementing the simulation study

Simulation Scenario Matrices.csv: information about the various parameters used for the simulations found in manuscript and supplementary materials

Simulation Results: a sub-folder that contains the simulation output used to create the tables and figures in the manuscript, includes README for folder

Figures_Code.R: code to create figures within the manuscript

Simulation_ParallelComputing_Code.R: code to run the simulations in parallel cores

Table 1_SM_Code.R: code to create the posterior weights example for supplementary materials table 1

Threshold_Calibration_Code.R: code to calibrate posterior probability thresholds for the approaches included in the simulations

Trial_Example_Code.R: code to generate the analytic trial example
